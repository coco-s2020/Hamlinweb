Hamlin girls code! The Hamlin School is dedicated to teaching girls programming skills starting in Kindergarten. In Lower School, students are introduced to computational thinking using iPad apps such as Kodable, Scratch Jr, and Lightbot. They later experiment with block-based programming languages like Hopscotch, Blockly, and Scratch.

Food Program
At Hamlin, we believe food is more than just sustenance. When we sit down together at lunch, we are not just nourishing our bodies, but also feeding our relationships with each other and building our community. The Hamlin Food Program values good food, diversity, community, learning, and simplicity. Through our partnership with Acre Gourmet, Hamlin is committed to serving our students delicious, wholesome food that is made from scratch with the highest quality ingredients. Eating a nutritious lunch is an essential part of our overall commitment to wellness. We encourage our students to be learners in the lunchroom, to explore new foods, to take responsibility for making healthy choices, and to find joy in a meal shared with friends. 


The Hamlin Creed and Food

"We are compassionate to our chefs and thank them for the food they make."

"It is important to be courageous and try new foods to grow our knowledge of different foods."

"You have to be honest with yourself and take what you need."

"We need to respect what food choices people make. We shouldn’t be yucking other people’s yums. Also we need to be respectful and say please and thank you to the people that spent time to make our wonderful food."

"We are responsible for our food choice, food waste, and behavior while at the tables. We have to choose the food that will keep us going for the rest of the day, even if it means adding a little kale to our diets." --Hamlin MS students
